# xml_meta
Scripting tool that takes an xml file and flattens it to a format where every tag becomes an element of a list. In current version the flattened format is then used to generate specific configurations settings file. With modification, the tool can be used to help with any type of xml parsing where flat format is needed.

POC that metadata can be generated from xml.
